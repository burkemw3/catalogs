Catalogs is a web-app for keeping track of catalog mailings.

I got a lot of catalogs (and other mailings) from various places.  I wasn't
very good about calling when I received the catalogs, and didn't want the
catalogs to pile up in my house.  When I called to stop receiving mailings,
there were usually a additional catalogs that would arrive.  This app tracks
when mail is received, so it can be recycled immediately.  It also tracks calls
to mail senders, to hold them to their end of the deal.
